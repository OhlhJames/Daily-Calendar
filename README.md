# Daily-Calendar

## Description

This is a tool that anyone can use to help planm their work day. It lets users choose which time they have an event coming up and allows them to save those events in real time! The page is comprised of a header that includes today's date, and then has nine time allotted sections that allow users to save events to certain times of the day.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage you start by selecting which time slot you'd like to add ann event to. After you've selected which time slot you're going to add the event to you click the text area between the selected time and the save button and you type in your event. Once you are done typing your event, you can then add it to local storage by clicking the save icon button next to it. This will allow users to close this webpage and open it later and still be able to access their needed events.

## Credits

Pulled README from Pre-Work-Study-Guide in my own repositories.
Used activity code provided from gitlab repository to start this project. Used previuos gitlab activities to reference best practices for using jQuery, also used these activity codes to form my loops so that the code would operate properly, along with referencing methods to pull certain data types. Used jQuery API documentation as a resource to understand how to properly use jQuery syntax so that my program would run properly, also used the documentation for assistance with referencing different attributes of divs. Cooperated with the TA Walter to help with a bug I enocountered where the 1st time slot was always future.
